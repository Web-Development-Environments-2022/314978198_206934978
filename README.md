## The Game Rules

You should know our game rules.
First, for moving on the board use the keys which selected.
What will give you more points? Eaying food!

There are three types of food points -
* *small = 5 points*
* *medium = 15 points*
* *large = 25 points*

You earn 50 points if you eat the moving money bag.
Bad news! You lose a 1 life and 10 points if a monster caught the pacman!

When the games end?
* Win: The time is up and the score is above 100 points.
* Lose: If the pacman loses all its lives (= a Loser) or if the time runs out and the score is below 100 points.

### Look at your settings options:

The number of food balls and the colors of the food points, the number of monsters, the time of the game, etc.

You can change preferences at random by clicking a button.
